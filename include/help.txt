Commands:
Pressing Ctrl-e will enter Entry mode which
enables the configuration of context using
commands.

	open path
Opens file at 'path'.

	saveas path
Renames file to 'path'.

	set configVar value
Sets 'configVar' to be 'value'.
'configVar' can be one of:
	tabSize        - tab size in spaces
	multiAmount    - amount of chars to move in Ctrl-Alt-movement key
	style          - style index
which take in a number or one of:
	displayLineNumbers
	autoIndent
	cursorLock
	cursorWrap
	smartHome
which take in a boolean value.
The use of spaces or tabs can be
set with:
	tabMode
which takes in either 'tabs' or 'spaces'.
The movement and deletion modes when pressing
Ctrl and Alt can also be set with:
	moveMode
	deleteMode
which take in one of 'multi', 'word', or 'pascal'.
'pascal' is like 'word' but is delimited by word casing 
rather than spaces/special chars.

	bind actionName keybinds...
Binds the action of 'actionName' to all of the
space-delimited keybinds in the 'keybinds...' arg.
For a full list of action names, go to:
	github.com/ethanwiebe/context/blob/master/include/actions.h

	style styleName fg bg [opts]
Sets the style of 'styleName' at the current style
index to {'fg', 'bg', 'opts'}. 'fg' and 'bg' should
be six character hex colors (ex. fabd2f) and opts
is 0-2 characters consisting of 'b' for bold and
'u' for underline (ex. bu = bold and underline).
A full list of style names can be viewed at:
	github.com/ethanwiebe/context/blob/master/include/stylename.h

The effects of these commands do not persist across
sessions. At start-up a file ~/.ctxcfg is checked
and if it exists all lines in the file will be executed 
as commands.
